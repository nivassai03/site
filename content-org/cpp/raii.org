Rule of Three
- If your class directly manages some kind of resource then you almost certainly need to hand-write three special member functions.

  - A desctructor
  - A Copy Constructor
  - A Copy assignment operator


Defaulted special member functions

when a special member function definition has the body=default; instead of a curly-braced compound statement, the compiler will create a defaulted version of that function, just as if it were implicitly generated.
Explicitly defaulting your special member can help your code to self-documenting


Rule of Zero

If your class does not directly manage any resource but merely uses library components such as vector and string,then you should strive to write no special member functions.
Default them all
Let the Compiler implicitly generate a defaulted destructor

Let the Compiler generate the copy constructor

Let the Compiler generate the copy assignment operator.
(But you own swap might improve performance).
